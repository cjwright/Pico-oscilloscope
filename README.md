# Pico-oscilloscope


This is a basic oscilloscope using a Raspberry Pi Pico ADC. Display via an ssd1306 OLED.

This only displays positive part of the waveform since ADC only reads positive values. Will need to add AC coupling and DC biasing, 2 resistors 1 capcitor, circuit to read complete waveform
